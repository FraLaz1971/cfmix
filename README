this example has been inspired by
Axel Kohlmeyer (Temple Univ.)
seminar "Mixing C, C++, and Fortran".
It shows how to call
functions compiled in c object code
from a fortran f77 program.
The makefile and test has been done
using gnu gcc gfortran compilers
that can run on GNU/linux, unix(es), 
MacOS and MS win (mingw gcc).
